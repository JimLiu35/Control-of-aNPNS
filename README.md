# Control-of-aNPNS
This repository contains all MATLAB and SimuLink files associated with the paper "Control of a Noncooperative Positive Nonlinear System by Augmented Positive Linear System Regulation."

# System Requirements
The MATLAB and SimuLink files only require a standard computer with enough RAMto support in-memory operations.

# Software Requirements
The MATLAB scripts and SimuLink modes were created using MATLAB R2023a. Therefore, MATLAB R2023a and SimuLink V10.7 and newer are recommended.
